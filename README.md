# CryptoGram project.

I worked in a group of 6 to design a prototype of a cryptocurrency trading platform using React and Typescript that won the “Best Project Award” of the module. If you wish to run it make sure to install and run both the backend and the frontend.

The part developed here is the Graphical User Interface.

To run this project first insure that the backEnd is running,

After that simply go to the folder with the project in your terminal

Run the following commands:

# npm install

# npm run

If asked whether to occupy a diffrent port, answer yes (Y)

The project should open in a browser, if a browser window doesn't open try those links:

http://localhost:3001
http://localhost:4000
